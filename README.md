# 🧪 Pool Chemistry Calculator (Offline Flutter App)

This is a mobile-first offline application built with Flutter for use by professional pool technicians. It calculates and displays pool chemical balancing recommendations based on five key parameters:

- **pH**
- **Chlorine**
- **Total Alkalinity (TA)**
- **Calcium Hardness (CH)**
- **Cyanuric Acid (CYA)**

Each result is shown in a clean, color-coded UI designed for fast visual scanning in the field. Calculations are based on real-world product dosing from industry-standard chemicals (like Balance Pak, Super Shock, Muriatic Acid, etc.).
