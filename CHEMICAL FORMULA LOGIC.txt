CHEMICAL FORMULA LOGIC:

PH: 0-14
Ideal range = 7.2-7.8
If over 7.8 use Muriatic Acid 31.45% to lower
dosage in L = 0.0000132 x pool volume x (current ph - 7.2)
If under 7.2 use Balance Pak 200 to increase
dosage in Kg = 0.00004 x pool volume x (7.5 - current ph)
WILL CONSIDER TA LATER (acid demand test)

CHLORINE: non negative
ideal range 3ppm-7.5ppm
If under 3ppm use super shock to increase
dosage in bags = upper limit of (pool volume x 0.015) / 400g upper limit
If over 7.5 use chlor-out to lower
dosage = pool volume x (current chlorine - 5) x 0.001


TA: non negative
ideal range 80-120ppm
if under 80 use Balance Pak 100 to increase
dosage = pool volume x (120 - current TA) x 0.0018
if over 120 use Muriatic Acid to lower
dosage = pool volume x (current TA - 90) x 0.0008 
WILL CONSIDER CYA AND PH LATER

CALCIUM: non negative
ideal range 200-400 for concrete
ideal range 150-250 for vinyl
focus on concrete only for now to increase
if under 200 use Balance Pak 300
dosage = pool volume x (200 - current calcium) x 0.0015
if over 400 backwash for a while

CYA: non negative
ideal range 30-50 for chlorine pools
ideal range 60-80 for salt water pools
WILL DO SALT LATER
if under 30 use stabilizer
dosage = pool volume x (50 - current cya) x 0.001
if over 50 backwash for a while
